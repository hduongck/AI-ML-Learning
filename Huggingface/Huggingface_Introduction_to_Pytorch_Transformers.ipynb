        "1. **Pre-trained models**: It provides pre-trained models for 6 State-of-the-Art NLP architectures and pre-trained weights for 27 variations of these models\n",
        "2. **Preprocessing and Finetuning API**: PyTorch-Transformers doesn’t stop at pre-trained weights. It also provides a simple API for doing all the preprocessing and finetuning steps required for these models. Now, if you have read recent research papers, you’d know many of the State-of-the-Art models have unique ways of preprocessing the data and a lot of times it becomes a hassle to write code for the entire preprocessing pipeline\n",
        "3. **Usage scripts**: It also comes with scripts to run these models against benchmark NLP datasets like SQUAD 2.0 (Stanford Question Answering Dataset), and GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation). By using PyTorch-Transformers, you can directly run your model against these datasets and evaluate the performance accordingly\n",
        "4. **Multilingual**: PyTorch-Transformers has multilingual support. This is because some of the models already work well for multiple languages\n",
        "5. **TensorFlow Compatibility**: You can import TensorFlow checkpoints as models in PyTorch\n",
        "6. **BERTology**: There is a growing field of study concerned with investigating the inner working of large-scale transformers like BERT (that some call “BERTology”)"
