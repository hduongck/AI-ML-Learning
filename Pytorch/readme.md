# Getting Comfortable with Pytorch & Projects
I would recommend this roadmap, if you haven’t dwelled into pytorch much. (docs in pytorch.org 8 are good enough.) Since there are a lot of resources it might be hard to structure your learning material. This is the one I’m following.

1. Start with this notebook from fastai_old 143, for me it was way better than what was provided in pytorch.org 8. (Edit from Jeremy: this notebook is now available as an [official pytorch tutorial 77](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html)!)
2. Go though pytorch in depth (basics), [Deep learning with pytorch : Deep lizard 139](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xrfNyHZsM6ufI0iZENK9xgG) might help. A huge chuck of its technical content is inspired from fastai’s ML course.
3. After that, Complete [Pytorch-DeepLearning-MiniCourse : by Alfredo Canziani 146](https://github.com/Atcold/pytorch-Deep-Learning-Minicourse). Take your time in understanding the content very well. Links to the video lectures and slides of this course are provided in the repo.
4. If your ML-DL basics are strong, you can skim though this [pytorch-ml-dl-rl-kaggle-kernel 87](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishpatel26/zero-to-hero-in-pytorch-ml-dl-rl/notebook) as well. Also, take it as a reference for making your own template.
if you are spending some time in understanding step 3. I would recommend to go through the notebooks in [fast_old/dev_nb 24](https://github.com/fastai/fastai_old/tree/master/dev_nb), parallely. @aakashns’s live webminar in his [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUu6crCNTDeSzbtXYuPMoLUpFfN0o_Fxs) 38 channel, will help.

**Important Extras :slight_smile**:

- Kaggle Competitions.
- Implement fastaiV1 notebooks only using pytorch. Implement test functions in the fastai library. ([Check this out](https://forums.fast.ai/t/plain-pytorch-implementation-of-fast-ai-notebooks/27810) 52)
- Implement an end to end pytroch based project, without using a jupyter notebook. I find this 45 project template very useful.
- Pytorch in production. An AI APP !
  [Pytorch —> Keras—> Android](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/deploying-pytorch-and-keras-models-to-android-with-tensorflow-mobile-a16a1fb83f2) 21 or [Pytorch—>Caffe—>Android](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_caffe2.html) 10 or [Pytorch—>IOS](https://medium.com/@alexiscreuzot/building-a-neural-style-transfer-app-on-ios-with-pytorch-and-coreml-76e00cd14b28) 22
- Implement a recent paper using pytorch. Attention Models : [Havard Nlp](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) 37 is a great resource.
- I think it will go hand in hand with the fastai v3 course. Just by being active in the forums, you’ll get inspiration for new project ideas.
