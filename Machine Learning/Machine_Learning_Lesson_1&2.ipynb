This is different from how most traditional math & technical courses are taught, where you have to learn all the individual elements before you can combine them (Harvard processor David Perkins call this elementilis) but it is similar to how topics like driving and baseball are taught. That is, you can start driving without knowing how an internal combustion engine works, and children begin playing baseball before they learn all the formal rules.\n",

        "\n",
        "There are two concepts you often hear -- curse of dimensionality and no free lunch theorem. They are both largely meaningless and basically stupid and yet many people in the field not only know that but think the opposite so it is well worth explaining. \n",
        "- **The curse of dimensionality** is this idea that the more columns you have, it creates a space that is more and more empty. There is this fascinating mathematical idea that the more dimensions you have, the more all of the points sit on the edge of the space. If you just have a single dimension where things are random, then they are spread out all over. Where else, if it is a square then the probability that they are in the middle means that they cannot be on the edge of either dimension so it is a little less likely that they are not on the edge. Each dimension you add, it becomes multiplicatively less likely that the point is not on the edge of at least one dimension, so in high dimensions, everything sits on the edge. What tha means in theory is that the distance between points is much less meaningful . So if we assume it matters, then it would suggest that when you have lots of columns and you just use them without being careful to remove the ones you do not care about that things which will not work. This turns out not to be the case for number of reasons.\n",
        "    - Points still do have different distances away from each other. Just because they are on the edge, they still vary on how far away they are from each other and so this point is more similar at this point than it is to that point. \n",
        "    - So things like k-nearest neighbors actually work really well in high dimensions despite what the theoretician claimed. What really happened here was that in 90's , theory took over machine learning. There was this concept of support vector machines(SVM) that was theoretically well justified, extremely easy to analyze mathematically, and you can prove things about them-- we lost a decade of real practical development. And all these theories became very popular like the curse of dimensionality.** Nowadays the world of machine learning has become very empirical and it turns out that in practice, building models on lots columns works really well**\n",
        "    \n",
        "- **No free lunch theorem** [41:08]: their claim is that is there no type of model that works well for any kind of dataset. In the mathematical sense, any random dataset by definition is random, so there is not going to be some way of looking at every possible random dataset that is in someway more useful than any other approach. In real world, we look at data which is not random. Mathematically we would say it sits on some lower dimensional manifold. It was created by some kind of causual structure. There are some relationships in there, so the truth is that we are not using random datasets and hence there are actually techniques that work much better than other techniques for nearly all of the datasets you look at. Nowadays, there are empirical researchers who study which techniques work a lot of the time. Ensembles of decisions trees, which random forest for one, is perhaps the technique which most often comes at the top. Fast.ai provides a standard way to pre-process them properly and set their parameters. \n",

Fast.ai provides a function called **train_cats** which creates categorical variables for everything that is a String. Behind the scenes, it creates a column that is an integer and it is going to store a mapping from the integers to the strings.**train_cats is called \"train\" because it is training data specific**. It is important that validation and test sets will use the same category mappings ( in other words, if you used 1 for \"high\" for a training dataset, then 1 should also be for \"high\" in validation and test datasets). **For validation and test dataset, use apply_cats** instead.\n"
