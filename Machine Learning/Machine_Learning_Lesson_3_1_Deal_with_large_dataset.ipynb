Given that the whole purpose here was to avoid running out of RAM, we do not want to use up 8 times more memory than necessary. When you are working with large datasets, very often you will find that the slow piece is reading and writing to RAM, not the CPU operations. Also as a rule of thumb, smaller data types often will run faster particularly if you can use **Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)** vectorized code, it can pack more numbers into a single vector to run at once.\n",

He created lots of columns based on this experience of what kinds of things tend to be useful for making predictions. So that is an approach that can work.

        "What Terrance did here was that he built four different models and submitted each of the four models to Kaggle to find out its score. X-axis is the score Kaggle told us on the leaderboard, and y-axis he plotted the score on a particular validation set he was trying out to see whether the validation set was going to be any good. If your validation set is good, then the relationship between the leaderboards score (i.e the test set score) should lie in a straight line. Ideally, It will lie on y = x line, but honestly that does not matter too much as long as relatively speaking it tells you which models are better than which other models, then you know which model is the best. In this case, Terrance has managed to come up with a validation set which looks like it is going to predict the Kaggle leaderboard score well. That is really cool because he can go away and try a hundred different types of models, feature engineering, weighting, tweaks, hyperparameters, whatever else , see how they go on the validation set , and not have to submit to Kaggle. So you will get a lot more iterations, a lot more feedback. This is not just true for Kaggle but every machine learning project you do. In general, if your validation set is not showing nice fit line, you need think carefully [48:02](https://youtu.be/YSFG_W8JxBo?t=48m2s). How is the test set constructed? How is my validation set different? You will have to draw lots of charts and so forth to find out. \n",
