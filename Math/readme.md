# [How to learn the Maths for Machine Learning quickly](https://medium.com/@ian.dzindo01/how-to-learn-the-maths-for-machine-learning-quickly-42f1ee3e648c)

Math is absolutely necessary for the study of Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence. Any deeper understanding of the concepts and algorithms in ML requires some basic maths knowledge. Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability and Differential Calculus appear all throughout ML, and you’ve probably read that you should study these for 2 or 3 months before even getting into the basics of ML.

Well, i’m here to tell you that this is not the best approach. Keep reading and I’ll list some resources and show you ways how you can get this done a lot quicker than 2 or 3 months.

Lots of people recommend either watching the MIT Open Courseware playlists on the maths subjects already mentioned, or going through the entire curriculum on Khan Academy. These are both amazing resources and will always be very helpful, but I think that they are both a bit too long and go into the subject a bit to deeply. You will spend around one and a half to two months completing each of these and, by the time you’re done, you’ll probably forget most of the things you learned.

Remember that you learn the best by doing, and sadly these courses don’t contain enough assignments and homework. What i recommend, and what worked for me, is learning only the basis of each of these branches: Statistics, Probability, Differential Equations and Derivatives; and doing some assignments regarding these subjects. I’m going to recommend to you some resources that worked wonders for me and i think that completing these is going to be enough to get you started with ML:

- [Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition_Provided by Microsoft](https://www.edx.org/course/essential-math-for-machine-learning-python-edition-3)
- [Paul Online Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)

The first url links to the amazing Microsoft course on edX, which covers the fundamentals of all of the maths branches that i listed above. It is interactive, it won’t be hard to follow and i was able to complete it in a week.

The second url links to another website which contains more assignments and practice problems, if you don’t find those on edX to be enough.

Completing these two resources should be enough to get you started. Of course, as you advance in Machine Learning you’re occasionaly going to have to learn some new maths concepts. But, i think that’s a lot better than investing 2 to 3 months skimming through material at the beginning and then forgetting half of what you learned by the time you encounter it.
