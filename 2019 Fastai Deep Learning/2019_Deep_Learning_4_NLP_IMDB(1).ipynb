We've looked a classification, localization, image regression. We briefly touched on NLP. We're going to do a deeper dive into NLP transfer learning today. We're going to then look at tabular data and collaborative filtering which are both super useful applications.\n",

So Jason in our study group was kind enough to rerun the experiments with the correct subset of classes from the paper, and our accuracy went up to 94% compared to 91.5% of the paper. So I think that's a really cool result. and a great example of how pretty much just using the defaults nowadays can get you far beyond what was the best of a year or two ago. It was certainly the best last year when we were doing this course because we started it quite intensely. So that's really exciting.\n",

We have, in the training set, 25,000 movie reviews and for each one we have like one bit of information: they liked it, or they didn't like it. That's what we're going to look into a lot more detail today and in the current lessons. Our neural networks (remember, they're just a bunch of matrix multiplies and simple nonlinearities﹣particularly replacing negatives with zeros), those weight matrices start out random. So if you start out with with some random parameters and try to train those parameters to learn how to recognize positive vs. negative movie reviews, you literally have 25,000 ones and zeros to actually tell you I like this one I don't like that one. That's clearly not enough information to learn, basically, how to speak English﹣how to speak English well enough to recognize they liked this or they didn't like this. Sometimes that can be pretty nuanced. Particularly with movie reviews because these are like online movie reviews on IMDB, people can often use sarcasm. It could be really quite tricky.\n",

        "Until very recently, in fact, this year, neural nets didn't do a good job at all of this kind of classification problem. And that was why﹣there's not enough information available. So the trick, hopefully you can all guess, is to use transfer learning. It's always the trick.\n",

        "The key thing is we're going to start with the same kind of thing that we used for computer vision﹣a pre-trained model that's been trained to do something different to what we're doing with it. For ImageNet, that was originally built as a model to predict which of a thousand categories each photo falls into. And people then fine-tune that for all kinds of different things as you've seen. So we're going to start with a pre-trained model that's going to do something else. Not movie review classification. We're going to start with a pre-trained model which is called a language model. **(my note)---> Image classification can use pre-trained model to predict new dataset but with text classification, we have to go with a language model first then do classification.**\n",
        "\n",
        "A language model has a very specific meaning in NLP and it's this. A language model is a model that learns to predict the next word of a sentence. To predict the next word of a sentence, you actually have to know quite a lot about English (assuming you're doing it in English) and quite a lot of world knowledge. By world knowledge, I'll give you an example.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's your language model and it has read:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"I'd like to eat a hot ___\": Obviously, \"dog\", right?\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"It was a hot ___\": Probably \"day\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Now previous approaches to NLP use something called n-grams largely which is basically saying how often do these pairs or triplets of words tend to appear next to each other. And n-grams are terrible at this kind of thing. As you can see, there's not enough information here to decide what the next word probably is. But with a neural net, you absolutely can**.\n",
        "\n",
        "So here's the nice thing. If you train a neural net to predict the next word of a sentence then you actually have a lot of information. Rather than having a single bit to every 2,000 word movie review: \"liked it\" or \"didn't like it\", every single word, you can try and predict the next word. So in a 2,000 word movie review, there are 1,999 opportunities to predict the next word. Better still, you don't just have to look at movie reviews. Because really the hard thing isn't so much as \"does this person like the movie or not?\" but \"how do you speak English?\". So you can learn \"how do you speak English?\" (roughly) from some much bigger set of documents. So what we did was we started with Wikipedia."

        "\n",
        "Stephen Merity and some of his colleagues built something called Wikitext 103 dataset which is simply a subset of most of the largest articles from Wikipedia with a little bit of pre-processing that's available for download. So you're basically grabbing Wikipedia and then I built a language model on all of Wikipedia. So I just built a neural net which would predict the next word in every significantly sized Wikipedia article. That's a lot of information. If I remember correctly, it's something like a billion tokens. So we've got a billion separate things to predict. Every time we make a mistake on one of those predictions, we get the loss, we get gradients from that, and we can update our weights, and they can better and better until we can get pretty good at predicting the next word of Wikipedia.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is that useful? Because at that point, I've got a model that knows probably how to complete sentences like this, so it knows quite a lot about English and quite a lot about how the world works﹣what kinds of things tend to be hot in different situations, for instance. Ideally, it would learn things like \"in 1996 in a speech to the United Nations, United States president _____ said \"... Now that would be a really good language model, because it would actually have to know who is this United States president in that year. So getting really good at training language models is a great way to teach a neural-net a lot about what is our world, what's in our world, how do things work in our world. It's a really fascinating topic, and it's actually one that philosophers have been studying for hundreds of years now. There's actually a whole theory of philosophy which is about what can be learned from studying language alone. So it turns out, apparently, quite a lot.\n",
        "\n",
        "So here's the interesting thing. You can start by training a language model on all of Wikipedia, and then we can make that available to all of you. Just like a pre-trained ImageNet model for vision, we've now made available a pre-trained Wikitext model for NLP not because it's particularly useful of itself (predicting the next word of sentences is somewhat useful, but not normally what we want to do), but it's a model that understands a lot about language and a lot about what language describes. So then, we can take that and we can do transfer learning to create a new language model that's specifically good at predicting the next word of movie reviews."

So for all of this pre-training and all of this language model fine-tuning, we don't need any labels at all. It is what the researcher Yann LeCun calls self supervised learning**. In other words, it's a classic supervised model﹣we have labels, but the labels are not things that somebody else have created. They're built into the dataset itself. So this is really really neat. Because at this point, we've now got something that's good at understanding movie reviews and we can fine-tune that with transfer learning to do the thing we want to do which in this case is to classify movie reviews to be positive or negative. So my hope was (when I tried this last year) that at that point, 25,000 ones and zeros would be enough feedback to fine-tune that model and it turned out it absolutely was.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Yes, absolutely it does. Particularly if you start with your wikitext model and then fine-tune it with your \"target\" corpus. Corpus is just a bunch of documents (emails, tweets, medical reports, or whatever). You could fine-tune it so it can learn a bit about the specifics of the slang , abbreviations, or whatever that didn't appear in the full corpus. So interestingly, this is one of the big things that people were surprised about when we did this research last year. People thought that learning from something like Wikipedia wouldn't be that helpful because it's not that representative of how people tend to write. But it turns out it's extremely helpful because there's a much a difference between Wikipedia and random words than there is between like Wikipedia and reddit. So it kind of gets you 99% of the way there.\n",

For example there was a [blog post](https://blog.swiftkey.com/swiftkey-debuts-worlds-first-smartphone-keyboard-powered-by-neural-networks/) from SwiftKey (the folks that do the mobile-phone predictive text keyboard) and they describe how they kind of rewrote their underlying model to use neural nets. This was a year or two ago. Now most phone keyboards seem to do this. You'll be typing away on your mobile phone, and in the prediction there will be something telling you what word you might want next. So that's a language model in your phone.\n",

              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "  xxmaj but this is just my opinion , watch it and decide for yourself .,xxbos i did n't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do . xxmaj it passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you ca n't sleep , although admittedly it 's no better quality than that . xxmaj it 's true that the acting is n't great - i thought xxmaj marianne mcandrew as xxmaj cathy xxmaj beck , for example , came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot did n't really make sense to me . xxmaj the xxmaj becks are on a trip described by xxmaj john ( xxmaj stewart xxmaj moss ) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had ( now that 's romantic ! ) xxmaj the work part has something to do with touring caves , which in itself sounds strange ( how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone 's work ? ) but it gets stranger when we find out that he 's a doctor doing research in the area of xxunk medicine ( huh ? xxmaj that connection completely lost me . ) xxmaj bitten by a bat while he 's in the cave , he begins to transform into what i guess was supposed to be a human - bat hybrid ( although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape - man of some sort ) and a killing spree starts . xxmaj here 's another problem . xxmaj the first killing is a nurse in a hospital . xxmaj at first , everyone thinks her death was an accident . xxmaj the second murder is of a young girl , who is described as having her throat ripped out . xxmaj the sheriff ( xxmaj michael xxmaj pataki ) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse 's ( meaning throat ripped out ? - xxmaj how could anyone think that was an accident ? ) xxmaj and what 's with the sheriff ? xxmaj he seems pretty no - nonsense until the scene in xxmaj cathy 's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her , after which everything seems to go back to normal . xxmaj it 's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved , and also with one of the most irritating theme songs i 've ever heard in a movie . xxmaj even for all that , there was something here that kept me watching . xxmaj sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half . xxmaj pretty bad , yeah - but not as awful as some people say .\n",

( altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors ) but suddenly , and with absolutely no hint of an xxunk as to how and why ... she 's evil herself and lures xxmaj hutson to his death , then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can , even after his ' dazzling ' performance on why no - one should ever venture there for whatever reason ... cue the nymphs stupidly xxunk each other around a bit for fun while xxmaj crazy pours petrol everywhere xxrep 4 . and here endeth the film xxrep 4 . finally ! xxmaj my conclusion xxrep 4 . if you had n't already guessed by now xxrep 4 . absolute rubbish ! xxmaj there was no proper thought went into it at all , whoever was aiming the camera needed firing ... and come to think of it so did 99 % of the cast ! xxmaj if the right director , actors , and budget got behind this it could have been decent . xxmaj but , once again , low - budget xxmaj english horror films but the rest of the genre , the country , and the xxmaj english film - making industry to shame ! ! ( xxmaj and i 'm xxmaj english so i 'm allowed to say that ) ! xxmaj in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15 - 20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area . xxmaj all i kept thinking throughout this was \" xxmaj jesus xxmaj christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this , its absolute cow 's testicles ! ! \" xxmaj but i ca n't turn a film off after i 've started watching it unfortunately . i had to watch xxmaj from xxmaj dusk xxmaj til xxmaj dawn afterwards just to remind myself that xxmaj tom xxmaj savini does have it in him to act well ! xxmaj if there was an option for 0 / 10 then believe me i woulda chose that , cuz this film is n't even worth the one point i did give it ! \n",

              "  xxmaj but this is just my opinion , watch it and decide for yourself .,xxbos i did n't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do . xxmaj it passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you ca n't sleep , although admittedly it 's no better quality than that . xxmaj it 's true that the acting is n't great - i thought xxmaj marianne mcandrew as xxmaj cathy xxmaj beck , for example , came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot did n't really make sense to me . xxmaj the xxmaj becks are on a trip described by xxmaj john ( xxmaj stewart xxmaj moss ) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had ( now that 's romantic ! ) xxmaj the work part has something to do with touring caves , which in itself sounds strange ( how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone 's work ? ) but it gets stranger when we find out that he 's a doctor doing research in the area of xxunk medicine ( huh ? xxmaj that connection completely lost me . ) xxmaj bitten by a bat while he 's in the cave , he begins to transform into what i guess was supposed to be a human - bat hybrid ( although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape - man of some sort ) and a killing spree starts . xxmaj here 's another problem . xxmaj the first killing is a nurse in a hospital . xxmaj at first , everyone thinks her death was an accident . xxmaj the second murder is of a young girl , who is described as having her throat ripped out . xxmaj the sheriff ( xxmaj michael xxmaj pataki ) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse 's ( meaning throat ripped out ? - xxmaj how could anyone think that was an accident ? ) xxmaj and what 's with the sheriff ? xxmaj he seems pretty no - nonsense until the scene in xxmaj cathy 's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her , after which everything seems to go back to normal . xxmaj it 's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved , and also with one of the most irritating theme songs i 've ever heard in a movie . xxmaj even for all that , there was something here that kept me watching . xxmaj sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half . xxmaj pretty bad , yeah - but not as awful as some people say .\n",

So probably tonight, I might train it overnight and try and do a little bit better. I'm guessing I could probably train this a bit longer because you can see the accuracy hasn't started going down again. So I wouldn't mind try to train that a bit longer. But the accuracy, it's interesting. 0.3 means we're guessing the next word of the movie review correctly about a third of the time. That sounds like a pretty high number﹣the idea that you can actually guess the next word that often. So it's a good sign that my language model is doing pretty well. For more limited domain documents (like medical transcripts and legal transcripts), you'll often find this accuracy gets a lot higher. So sometimes this can be even 50% or more. But 0.3 or more is pretty good."

        "We're already up nearly to 92% accuracy after less than three minutes of training. So this is a nice thing. In your particular domain (whether it be law, medicine, journalism, government, or whatever), you probably only need to train your domain's language model once. And that might take overnight to train well. But once you've got it, you can now very quickly create all kinds of different classifiers and models with that. In this case, already a pretty good model after three minutes. So when you first start doing this. you might find it a bit annoying that your first models take four hours or more to create that language model. But the key thing to remember is you only have to do that once for your entire domain of stuff that you're interested in. And then you can build lots of different classifiers and other models on top of that in a few minutes."

        "Good question. So the learning rate is various things divided by 2.6 to the fourth. The reason it's to the fourth, you will learn about at the end of today. So let's focus on the 2.6. Why 2.6? Basically, as we're going to see in more detail later today, this number, the difference between the bottom of the slice and the top of the slice is basically what's the difference between how quickly the lowest layer of the model learns versus the highest layer of the model learns. So this is called discriminative learning rates. So really the question is as you go from layer to layer, how much do I decrease the learning rate by? And we found out that for NLP RNNs, the answer is 2.6.\n",
        "\n",
        "How do we find out that it's 2.6? I ran lots and lots of different models using lots of different sets of hyper parameters of various types (dropout, learning rates, and discriminative learning rate and so forth), and then I created something called a random forest which is a kind of model where I attempted to predict how accurate my NLP classifier would be based on the hyper parameters. And then I used random forest interpretation methods to basically figure out what the optimal parameter settings were, and I found out that the answer for this number was 2.6. So that's actually not something I've published or I don't think I've even talked about it before, so there's a new piece of information. Actually, a few months after I did this, Stephen Merity and somebody else did publish a paper describing a similar approach, so the basic idea may be out there already.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of that idea comes from a researcher named Frank Hutter and one of his collaborators. They did some interesting work showing how you can use random forests to actually find optimal hyperparameters. So it's kind of a neat trick. A lot of people are very interested in this thing called Auto ML which is this idea of like building models to figure out how to train your model. We're not big fans of it on the whole. But we do find that building models to better understand how your hyper parameters work, and then finding those rules of thumb like oh basically it can always be 2.6 quite helpful. So there's just something we've kind of been playing with."
