        "Using neural nets for analyzing tabular data﹣when we first presented this, people were deeply skeptical. They thought it was a terrible idea to use neural nets to analyze tabular data, because everybody knows that you should use logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting machines (all of which have their place for certain types of things). But since that time, it's become clear that the commonly held wisdom is wrong. It's not true that neural nets are not useful for tabular data ,in fact they are extremely useful. We've shown this in quite a few of our courses, but what's really helped is that some really effective organizations have started publishing papers and posts describing how they've been using neural nets for analyzing tabular data.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key things that comes up again and again is that although feature engineering doesn't go away, it certainly becomes simpler. So Pinterest, for example, replaced the gradient boosting machines that they were using to decide how to put stuff on their homepage with neural nets. And they presented at a conference this approach, and they described how it really made engineering a lot easier because a lot of the hand created features weren't necessary anymore. You still need some, but it was just simpler. So they ended up with something that was more accurate, but perhaps even more importantly, it required less maintenance. So I wouldn't say you it's the only tool that you need in your toolbox for analyzing tabular data. But where else, I used to use random forests 99% of the time when I was doing machine learning with tabular data, I now use neural nets 90% of the time. It's my standard first go-to approach now, and it tends to be pretty reliable and effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the things that's made it difficult is that until now there hasn't been an easy way to create and train tabular neural nets. Nobody has really made it available in a library. So we've actually just created **fastai.tabular** and I think this is pretty much the first time that's become really easy to use neural nets with tabular data. So let me show you how easy it is\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question**: What are the 10% of cases where you would not default to neural nets? [40:41](https://youtu.be/C9UdVPE3ynA?t=2441)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Good question. I guess I still tend to give them a try. But yeah, I don't know. It's kind of like as you do things for a while, you start to get a sense of the areas where things don't quite work as well. I have to think about that during the week. I don't think I have a rule of thumb. But I would say, you may as well try both. I would say try a random forest and try a neural net. They're both pretty quick and easy to run, and see how it looks. If they're roughly similar, I might dig into each and see if I can make them better. But if the random forest is doing way better, I'd probably just stick with that. Use whatever works..\n"

        "- What the data frame is.\n",
        "- What the path that you're going to use to save models and intermediate steps is.\n",
        "- Then you need to tell it what are your categorical variables and what are your continuous variables.\n",

        "We're going to be learning a lot more about what that means to the neural net next week, but for now the quick summary is this. Your independent variables are the things that you're using to make predictions with. So things like education, marital status, age, and so forth. Some of those variables like age are basically numbers. They could be any number. You could be 13.36 years old or 19.4 years old or whatever. Where else, things like marital status are options that can be selected from a discrete group: married, single, divorced, whatever. Sometimes those options might be quite a lot more, like occupation. There's a lot of possible occupations. And sometimes, they might be binary (i.e. true or false). But anything which you can select the answer from a small group of possibilities is called a **categorical variable**. So we're going to need to use a different approach in the neural net to modeling categorical variables to what we use for continuous variables. **For categorical variables, we're going to be using something called embeddings** which we'll be learning about later today. For continuous variables, they could just be sent into the neural net just like pixels in a neural net can. Because pixels in a neural net are already numbers; these continuous things are already numbers as well. So that's easy.\n",
        "\n",
        "So that's why you have to tell the tabular list from data frame which ones are which. There are some other ways to do that by pre-processing them in Pandas to make things categorical variables, but it's kind of nice to have one API for doing everything; you don't have to think too much about it.\n",

        "\n",
        "Then we've got something which is a lot like transforms in computer vision. Transforms in computer vision do things like flip a photo on its axis, turn it a bit, brighten it, or normalize it. But for tabular data, instead of having transforms, we have things called processes. And they're nearly identical but the key difference, which is quite important, is that a processor is something that happens ahead of time. So we basically pre-process the data frame rather than doing it as we go. So transformations are really for data augmentation﹣we want to randomize it and do it differently each time. Or else, processes are the things that you want to do once, ahead of time.\n",

        "- **Categorify**: Find categorical variables and turn them into Pandas categories\n",
        "- **Normalize** : Do a normalization ahead of time which is to take continuous variables and subtract their mean and divide by their standard deviation so they are zero-one variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The way we deal with missing data, we'll talk more about next week, but in short, we replace it with the median and add a new column which is a binary column of saying whether that was missing or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "For all of these things, whatever you do to the training set, you need to do exactly the same thing to the validation set and the test set. So whatever you replaced your missing values with, you need to replace them with exactly the same thing in the validation set. So fastai handles all these details for you. They are the kinds of things that if you have to do it manually, if you're like me, you'll screw it up lots of times until you finally get it right. So that's what these processes are here.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we're going to split into training versus validation sets. And in this case, we do it by providing a list of indexes so the indexes from 800 to a thousand. It's very common. I don't quite remember the details of this dataset, but it's very common for wanting to keep your validation sets to be contiguous groups of things. If they're map tiles, they should be the map tiles that are next to each other, if their time periods, they should be days that are next to each other, if they are video frames, they should be video frames next to each other. Because otherwise you're kind of cheating. So it's often a good idea to use split_by_idx and to grab a range that's next to each other if your data has some kind of structure like that or find some other way to structure it in that way.\n",
        "\n",
        "All right, so that's now given us a training and a validation set. We now need to add labels. In this case, the labels can come straight from the data frame we grabbed earlier, so we just have to tell it which column it is. So the dependent variable is whether they're making over `$50,000` salary. That's the thing we're trying to predict.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll talk about test sets later, but in this case we can add a test set. And finally get our data bunch. S at that point, we have something that looks like this:"

        "Yeah, we're not quite up to that yet. So we need to learn a little bit more about how neural net architectures work as well. But conceptually, it's kind of the same as the way we combine categorical variables and continuous variables. Basically in the neural network, you can have two different sets of inputs merging together into some layer. It could go into an early layer or into a later layer, it kind of depends. If it's like text and an image and some metadata, you probably want the text going into an RNN, the image going into a CNN, the metadata going into some kind of tabular model like this. And then you'd have them basically all concatenated together, and then go through some fully connected layers and train them end to end. We will probably largely get into that in part two. In fact we might entirely get into that in part two. I'm not sure if we have time to cover it in part one. But conceptually, it's a fairly simple extension of what we'll be learning in the next three weeks.\n",

        "I have no idea. I'm not good at making predictions. I'm not a machine learning model. I mean xgboost is a really nice piece of software. There's quite a few really nice pieces of software for gradient boosting in particular. Actually, random forests in particular has some really nice features for interpretation which I'm sure we'll find similar versions for neural nets, but they don't necessarily exist yet. So I don't know. For now, they're both useful tools. scikit-learn is a library that's often used for pre-processing and running models. Again, it's hard to predict where things will end up. In some ways, it's more focused on some older approaches to modeling, but I don't know. They keep on adding new things, so we'll see. I keep trying to incorporate more scikit-learn stuff into fastai and then I keep finding ways I think I can do it better and I throw it away again, so that's why there's still no scikit-learn dependencies in fastai. I keep finding other ways to do stuff.\n",

We'll look at more about metrics in a moment, but just to remind you, metrics are just the things that get printed out. They don't change our model at all. So in this case, we're saying I want you to print out the accuracy to see how we're doing.\n",

So in the most basic version of collaborative filtering, you just have two columns: something like user ID and movie ID and that just says this user bought that movie. So for example, Amazon has a really big list of user IDs and product IDs like what did you buy. Then you can add additional information to that table such as oh, they left a review, what review did they give it? So it's now like user ID, movie ID, number of stars. You could add a timecode so this user bought this product at this time and gave it this review. But they are all basically the same structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two ways you could draw that collaborative filtering structure. One is a two-column approach where you've got user and movie. And you've got user ID, movie ID﹣each pair basically describes that user watch that movie, possibly also number of stars (3, 4, etc). The other way you could write it would be you could have like all the users down here and all the movies along here. And then, you can look and find a particular cell in there to find out what could be the rating of that user for that movie, or there's just a 1 there if that user watched that movie, or whatever.\n",

Conceptually, it's often easier to think of it this way (the matrix on the right), but most of the time you won't store it that way. Explicitly because most of the time, you'll have what's called a very **sparse matrix which is to say most users haven't watched most movies or most customers haven't purchased most products**. \n",

        "- **So if you store it as a matrix where every combination of customer and product is a separate cell in that matrix, it's going to be enormous**. So you tend to store it like the left or you can store it as a matrix using some kind of special sparse matrix format. If that sounds interesting, you should check out Rachel's computational linear algebra course on fastai where we have lots and lots of information about sparse matrix storage approaches. For now though, we're just going to kind of keep it in this format on left hand side.\n",

In past classes, a lot of people have taken this collaborative filtering approach back to their workplaces and discovered that using it in practice is much more tricky than this. Because in practice, you have something called the cold start problem. So **the cold start problem is that the time you particularly want to be good at recommending movies is when you have a new user, and the time you particularly care about recommending a movie is when it's a new movie. But at that point, you don't have any data in your collaborative filtering system and it's really hard.**\n",

They found like 20 really common movies and asked me if I liked them, they used my replies to those 20 to show me 20 more that I might have seen, and by the time I had gone through 60, there was no cold start problem anymore.\n",
        "\n",

There's not many emojis in Wikipedia and where they are at Wikipedia it's more like a Wikipedia page about the emoji rather than the emoji being used in a sensible place. But you can (and should) do this language model fine-tuning where you take a corpus of text where people are using emojis in usual ways, and so you fine-tune the Wikitext language model to your reddit or Twitter or whatever language model. And there aren't that many emojis if you think about it. There are hundreds of thousands of possible words that people can be using, but a small number of possible emojis. So it'll very quickly learn how those emojis are being used. So that's a piece of cake.\n",
        "\n",
        "- I'm not really familiar with Hindi, but I'll take an example I'm very familiar with which is Mandarin. In Mandarin, you could have a model that's trained with Chinese characters. There are about five or six thousand Chinese characters in common use, but there's also a romanization of those characters called pinyin. It's a bit tricky because although there's a nearly direct mapping from the character to the pinyin (I mean there is a direct mapping but that pronunciations are not exactly direct), there isn't direct mapping from the pinyin to the character because one pinyin corresponds to multiple characters.\n",

So you would you obviously start there.\n",

So that second part is going to require a few more weeks of learning before you exactly understand how to do that and so forth, but if this is something you're interested in doing, we can talk about it on the forum because it's a nice test of understanding.\n",

And thanks to spreadsheets, we can just do that in one place and copy it over, and it fills in the whole thing for us. Why would we do it this way? Well, this is the basic starting point of a neural net, isn't it? A basic starting point of a neural net is that you take the matrix multiplication of two matrices, and that's what your first layer always is. So we just have to come up with some way of saying what are two matrices that we can multiply. Clearly, you need a vector for a user (a matrix for all the users) and a vector for a movie (a matrix for all the movies) and multiply them together, and you get some numbers. So they don't mean anything yet. They're just random.

With this random matrices, it's actually a rating of 0.91, so we can find the sum of squared errors would be $(3-0.91)^{2}$ and then we can add them up. So there's actually a sum squared in Excel already sum X minus y squared (**SUMXMY2**), so we can use just sum X minus y squared function, passing in those two ranges and then divide by the count to get the mean.\n",

So the the function that was called in the notebook was **collab_learner** and as you dig deeper into deep learning, one of the really good ways to dig deeper into deep learning is to dig into the fastai source code and see what's going on. So if you're going to be able to do that, you need to know how to use your editor well enough to dig through the source code. Basically there are two main things you need to know how to do:\n",

In most editors including the one I use, vim, you can set it up so that you can hit tab or something and it jumps through all the possible completions, and you can hit enter and it jumps straight to the definition for you. So here is the definition of collab_learner. As you can see, it's pretty small as these things tend to be, and the key thing it does is to create model of a particular kind which is an EmbeddingDotBias model passing in the various things you asked for. So you want to find out in your editor how you jump to the definition of that, which in vim you just hit Ctrl+] and here is the definition of EmbeddingDotBias.\n",

And a PyTorch model is called an **nn.Module** that's the name in PyTorch of their models. It's a little more nuanced than that, but that's a good starting point for now. When a PyTorch **nn.Module** is run (when you calculate the result of that layer, neural net, etc), specifically, it always calls a method for you called **forward**. So it's in here that you get to find out how this thing is actually calculated.\n",

So I don't really just want to multiply these two vectors together, but I really want to add a single number of like how popular is this movie, and add a single number of like how much does this user like movies in general. So those are called \"bias\" terms. Remember how I said there's this idea of bias and the way we dealt with that in our gradient descent notebook was we added a column of 1's. But what we tend to do in practice is we actually explicitly say I want to add a bias term. So we don't just want to have prediction equals dot product of these two things, we want to say it's the dot product of those two things plus a bias term for a movie plus a bias term for user ID."
