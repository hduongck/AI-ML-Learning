        "Rectangle means an input. That'll be batch size by number of inputs. An arrow means a layer (broadly defined) such as matrix product followed by ReLU. A circle is activations. So this case, we have one set of hidden activations and so given that the input was number of inputs, this here (the first arrow) is a matrix of number of inputs by number of activations. So the output will be batch size by a number of activations.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's really important you know how to calculate these shapes. So go **learn.summary()** lots to see all the shapes. Then here's another arrow, so that means it's another layer; matrix product followed by non-linearity. In this case, we go into the output, so we use softmax.\n",

Let's now imagine that we wanted to get a big document, split it into sets of three words at a time, and grab each set of three words and then try to predict the third word using the first two words. If we had the dataset in place, we could:\n",

        "1. Grab word 1 as an input.\n",
        "2. Chuck it through an embedding, create some activations.\n",

        "4. Grab the second word.\n",
        "5. Put it through an embedding.\n",
        "6. Then we could either add those two things together or concatenate them. Generally speaking, when you see two sets of activations coming together in a diagram, you normally have a choice of concatenate or or add. And that's going to create the second bunch of activations.\n",
        "7. Then you can put it through one more fully connected layer and softmax to create an output.\n",
        "\n",
        "So that would be a totally standard, fully connected neural net with one very minor tweak which is concatenating or adding at this point, which we could use to try to predict the third word from pairs of two words.\n",

        "Let's go further. What if we wanted to predict word 4 using words 1 and 2 and 3? It's basically the same picture as last time except with one extra input and one extra circle. But I want to point something out which is each time we go from rectangle to circle, we're doing the same thing - we're doing an embedding. Which is just a particular kind of matrix multiply where you have a one hot encoded input. Each time we go from circle to circle, we're basically taking one piece of hidden state (a.k.a activations) and turning it into another set of activations by saying we're now at the next word. Then when we go from circle to triangle, we're doing something else again which is we're saying let's convert the hidden state (i.e. these activations) into an output. So I've colored each of those arrows differently. Each of those arrows should probably use the same weight matrix because it's doing the same thing. So why would you have a different set of embeddings for each word or a different matrix to multiply by to go from this hidden state to this hidden state versus this one? So this is what we're going to build.\n",

Assuming that there is a second word, because sometimes we might be at the end of a batch where there isn't a second word. Assume there is a second word then we would add to h the result of x[1] put through the green arrow (that's i_h).

So when you start creating long timescales and multiple layers, these things get impossible to train. There's a few tricks you can do. One thing is you can add skip connections, of course. But what people normally do is, instead of just adding these together(green and orange arrows), they actually use a little mini neural net to decide how much of the green arrow to keep and how much of the orange arrow to keep. When you do that, you get something that's either called GRU or LSTM depending on the details of that little neural net. And we'll learn about the details of those neural nets in part 2. They really don't matter though, frankly.\n",

        "And we're up to 82%. That's RNNs and the main reason I wanted to show it to you was to remove the last remaining piece of magic, and this is one of the least magical things we have in deep learning. It's just a refactored fully connected network. So don't let RNNs ever put you off. With this approach where you basically have a sequence of n inputs and a sequence of n outputs we've been using for language modeling, you can use that for other tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the sequence of outputs could be for every word there could be something saying is there something that is sensitive and I want to anonymize or not. So it says private data or not. Or it could be a part of speech tag for that word, or it could be something saying how should that word be formatted, or whatever. These are called **sequence labeling tasks** and so you can use this same approach for pretty much any sequence labeling task. Or you can do what I did in the earlier lesson which is once you finish building your language model, you can throw away the h_o bit, and instead pop there a standard classification head, and then you can now do NLP classification which as you saw earlier will give you a state of the art results even on long documents. So this is a super valuable technique, and not remotely magical."
